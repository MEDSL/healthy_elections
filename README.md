A Repository for data related to elections and the COVID-19 pandemic

This is the collection of data for the MIT Elections Data and Science Lab. Data is collected from the states regarding elections held during the COVID-19 pandemic, comparisons to prior years, and descriptive analyses for trends of interest that impact the safe handling of elections. 

The format of the repository is such that initial data is broken by state, with topic categories (i.e. poll closures, differences in election night results v official results, etc.) arising as more data is acquired. The repository also contains data related to COVID-19 over time, which is from the New York Times, the link here: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data . 

Due to space limitations, voter files and similarly sized files are not posted on the repository.
